    <h1 font-family="arial">World Wide Web vs the Internet</h1> 
    <p font-size="25px">The <i><b>World Wide Web</b></i> is what you can view on your device. It is the pages acessible to users,
        and is what most of us would refer to when thinking of the 'internet' or online prescence. 
        However, the <i><b>Internet</b></i> is actually referring to the network of computers, storage units and other devices
        all connected through technology.
